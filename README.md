# Wikipedia-Users
ðŸ“š ðŸ‘€ Quick look into behavioral characteristics and usage metrics of Wikipedia users based on event logging (EL) data ðŸ’»

In this analysis I dived into Wikipedia's event logging (EL) data from a little over one week to answer the following questions:

1. What is Wikipedia daily overall clickthrough rate? How does it vary between the groups A and B?
2. Which results do people tend to try first? How does it change day-to-day?
3. What is Wikipedia's daily overall zero results rate? How does it vary between the groups?
4. Let session length be approximately the time between the first event and the last event in a session. Choose a variable from the dataset and describe its relationship to session length. Visualize the relationship.
